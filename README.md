# flutter_workshop

This repo is solely for the Flutter Workshop.
This code needs to be taken lightly and doesn’t represent the total power we have as developers. This is for n00bs and not for l33t warriors like ourselves.
Please feel free to download and use the code it wisely. Any disrespect will be utterly punishable by shame. Shame! SHAME!
Please don’t.
